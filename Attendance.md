# SEIR Best Practices

## Attendance

SEIRs will drop an attendance token on SIS everyday class is in session at precisely the following times:
- 9:00am
- 1:45pm
- 5:00pm 
Take care to ensure that these times are in the timezone of the cohort over which you are presiding.

When the token is dropped, at least one SEIR should verbally announce that it has been dropped in the Zoom meeting and remind all students they should be visible on camera. Students who are not visible on camera by 5 minutes after the token has been dropped should be marked *tardy*. 

In addition, when the token is dropped, at least one SEIR should alert the students by way of the Live Channel in Slack, using @here to make sure that all members of that channel get the notification. Here's an example: "@here Attendance token is live! You have until 9:05am PST! *professional emoji of your choice*"

While the students are submitting their token, one or more SEIRs need to audit whether or not the students submitting their tokens are actually present. One way to do this is to click ![Take attendance](/assets/take.png)
