# SEIR Best Practices

## Attendance

SEIRs will drop an attendance token on SIS everyday class is in session at precisely the following times:
- 9:00am
- 1:45pm
- 5:00pm 
Take care to ensure that these times are in the timezone of the cohort over which you are presiding.

Students that join the meeting after the token expires and up to 15 minutes late should be marked as tardy. Any students joining after that time should be marked absent. 

### Announcing

When the token is dropped, at least one SEIR should verbally announce that it has been dropped in the Zoom meeting and remind all students they should be visible on camera. Students who are not visible on camera by 5 minutes after the token has been dropped should be marked *tardy*. 

In addition, when the token is dropped, at least one SEIR should alert the students by way of the Live Channel in Slack, using @here to make sure that all members of that channel get the notification. Here's an example: "@here Attendance token is live! You have until 9:05am PST! *professional emoji of your choice*"

### Auditing

While the students are submitting their token, one or more SEIRs need to audit whether or not the students submitting their tokens are actually present. One way to do this is to click on the âœ‹ Take button in SIS which will allow you view the live feed of all the students who have submitted their attendance token. The SEIR can then open the participants tab of the Zoom meeting and, going down the live feed one by one, type the students names into the participants search bar to ensure that the students are there. The SEIR should then check that all of the students are visible on camera. 

### Reporting

After attendance has been taken for that portion of the day, one SEIR must report in the Attendance Slack Channel in the following format:

DATE ONE OF(Morning/Afternoon/Evening):

Tardy:
*list of tardy students*

Absent:
*list of absent students*

Excused:
*list of excused students*

Note, if a student should be marked excused, that will have been reported by their Cohort Lead (CL) along with a note that should be included on the token page when you submit their excusal.

### Revisions

If a student requests that you "give them their token back" because of some excuse or another, you must first get approved from their CL. **No revisions to student attendance should be made with the CL's approval outside of a SEIR pressing the wrong button after the attendance token has expired (e.g. pressing "Excused" when the student should have been marked "Tardy.")**
