# SEIR Training Manual

Congratulations and welcome, new SEIRs!! This tutorial was originally created by [Dre Ramirez](https://github.com/dreramirez91) to help new hires navigate the role and responsibilities of a SEIR beyond the onboarding period.

As the needs of students and staff change, so do the work of the SEIRs. This training manual should serve as a guide, but not a rulebook -- you've got a lot of flexibility in this role to make the changes you think would benefit your classroom best.

I will be maintaining this guide until my contract expires at the end of June 2024. Feel free to fork/duplicate and make any changes or additions you see fit to continue this training manual for future SEIRs ðŸ˜Š
