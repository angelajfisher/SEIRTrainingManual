# Breakout Rooms

As a standard practice, the following breakout rooms should be included each time breakout rooms are created:

- Separate offices for each Cohort Lead(CL) where they will hold their office hours and which provides them an easily accessible designated space to have one-off meetings with instructors, SEIRs, or instructors

- Instructor 1, 2, and 3 rooms used these to meet with one another and to prepare for lectures

*Note: Each module instructor team will have different needs and requests as it related to breakout rooms.*

There should NOT be a designated SEIR breakout room. Your role as a SEIR is to provide student technical support, and some operational support, and this relies entirely on you being visible and accessible - neither of which is true if you’re hidden away in a breakout room! For this reason, the main room is your room, and if you’re spending more than 15-20 mins there just doing nothing (HMU and PC channels are all quiet), then you should be making a habit of rotating through breakout rooms to observe, drop a knowledge gem, just chat - really start building those relationships with students. This is so key here in the early weeks of M1, if you want to establish yourself as someone they can trust as they progress through the program. 

To build on this, we’ve consistently, across modules, received feedback from students that having too many breakout rooms open here in M1 makes it too easy for them to slink away and not make any connections at all. To this end, we ask that student breakout rooms number, in total, no more than half of the student enrollment (ie 80 students = no more than 40 breakout rooms), and a handful of “Quiet study” rooms are created where students can co-work without being specifically invited to do so.

And! Because collecting overachievers on my team is a passion, one of my former SEIRs created this handy dandy guide to breakout room creation!
